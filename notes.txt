https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-lab3’s output seems correct, besides “grade.sh: line 35: =FAILURES!!!: command not found”. For https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-corrected, the output should not say “Sorry, you failed the tests.” especially since you can see right below that the test was passed. https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-compile-error seems to have the correct output. https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-signature should fail but the output has conflicting signals; there is a line that says the tests were failed and some lines that show the output of a successful test. https://github.com/ucsd-cse15l-f22/list-methods-filename seems to have the correct output. 

In general, grade.sh seems pretty good before line 35, but line 35 and after is confusing to me and seems to mess up your output.
